<h2>Why</h2>

<p>
	Using systemd-networkd provides a very low dependency solution, as it comes
	 with systemd.
	This comes in handy in headless or fresh installations such as a fresh arch
	 linux install or an internet enabled raspberry pi.
</p>
<p>
	I have been using systemd-networkd for a while but it really came in handy
	after a recent arch-linux install on a laptop.
	I had forgotten to install <code>dialog</code> and thus was missing a
	 dependency for the pre installed <code>wifi-menu</code> and was almost left
	 high and dry (network cable or reboot into the installer).
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<code><li>systemd</code></li>
<code><li>systemd-networkd</code></li>
<code><li>systemd-resolved (optionally)(for dns)</code></li>
<code><li>wpa_supplicant (optionally)(for wifi)</code></li>
<p>
	To use systemd-networkd for your networking you will obviously need to be
	 using systemd, fortunately on many systems this is the default and will make it
   easier in places when you want a low dependency networking solution.
	You will need <code>wpa_supplicant</code> if you want to connect to secured
	 wifi networks, and <code>systemd-resolved</code> if you want an <em>all in
	 one</em> solution with no extra dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>Networkd</h3>

<p>
	The first step is to create a <code>.network</code> file. this file will exist
	 in your <code>/etc/system/network/</code> folder and should be named, ideally,
	 something along the lines of <code>lan.network</code> and contain something
	 of the following.
	<code><pre>
	[Name]
	Match=eth0

	[Network]
	DHCP=ipv4
	</pre></code>
	where <code>eth0</code> would match your wired adapter name, also commonly
	 appears as <code>enp0s3</code>.
	you can also use globs here to match all adapters, for example
	 <code>enp*</code>.
	<br>
	to find out what the name of your adapter is simply run <code>ip a</code> or
	on older systems <code>ifconfig</code>.
	<br>
	alternatively for a wireless configuration, simply enter your wireless adapter
	name into the <b>Match</b> field.
</p>

<h3>WPA Supplicant</h3>

<p>
	You can safely skip this if you are setting up a wired connection.
</p>

<p>
	First you need to create the <code>wpa_supplicant</code> file for your
	 interface, identified in the last step, at
	 <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf</code>.
	<br>
	The file should take the following shape.
	<code><pre>
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1
	country=GB

	network={
	        ssid="SSID"
	        psk="PASSWORD"
	}</pre></code>
	Filling in <em>ssid</em> and <em>psk</em> as required.
</p>

<h3>Finishing Up</h3>

<p>
	Now you need to start the services using the standard systemctl command, as
	 follows.
	<code><pre>
	systemctl enable systemd-networkd
	systemctl start systemd-networkd
	</pre></code>

	If you are using wifi then also enable and start the wpa_supplicant service at
	 the interface you identified.
	<code><pre>
	systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0
	systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlan0
	</pre></code>

	And if you aren't using another dns resolver, you can use systemd resolved as
	 follows
	<code><pre>
	systemctl enable systemd-resolvd
	systemctl start systemd-resolvd
	</pre></code>

	Uou can find any errors by running <code>systemctl status</code> and the
	 service if the link doesn't come up.
