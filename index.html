<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	My name is Shaw Eastwood.
	I am a BSc Computer Science graduate from <b>Robert Gordon University</b>
	 with an interest in all things technical and a free-software enthusiast.
	<br/>
	Over the past four years I have been slowly migrating over to Linux
	 in all aspects of my computing workload and have, in the past six
	 months, found a great appreciation in the Unix and, especially, the
	 <a href="http://suckless.org">Suckless</a> philosophies.
	This has led me to my current love of the CLI (command-line) which allows,
	 ideally with <em>vimkeys</em>.
	<br/>
	I am currently employed as a Software Engineer, working on projects with a
	 <b>PHP</b> and <b>C#</b> stack.
	My goal is learning <b>C</b> to pursue a career working on embedded devices
	 and control systems.
	I am fortunate to be allowed to utilize my preferred technology stack when
	 working with these technologies, most importantly <b>Vim</b>, but also
	 <a href="dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>, which I have found to be almost essential
	 to my workflow.
</p>
<p>
	Through my work on front end portals and client facing interfaces, I have
	 developed an appreciating for <em>(good)</em> UX, a facet of development I
	 believe is sorely overlooked.
