	<h2>about me</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Shaw Eastwood.
		I am a BSc Computer Science graduate from <b>Robert Gordon University</b>
		 with an interest all things technical and a free-software enthusiast.
	<br/>
		Over the past four years I have been slowly migrating over the Linux
		 in all aspects of my computing worklaod and have, in the past six
		 months, found a great appreciation in the Unix and especially the
		 <a href="http://suckless.org">Suckless</a> philosophies.
		This has led me to my current love of the CLI (command-line) and
		<em>ncurses</em> interfaces, ideally with <em>vimkeys</em>.
	<br/>
	I am currently working towards learning <b>C</b> to persue a career in
		 Software Engineering, working on embedded devices and control systems.
